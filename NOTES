Requirements: Plan on spending somewhere in the ball park of 6 to 12
hours. It’s really up to you, but I don’t want you to feel like you
have to do every possible thing and end up spending 40 hours or
something. Implement a web based API to keep track of a tic-tac-toe
game. You should be able to accept moves, reject invalid moves, and
determine when the game has ended. You have flexibility to make it work
in any way you feel is best.

Include installation and usage documentation. We should be able to get
it up and running on a Linux machine here. (Sorry, it would be too hard
to hunt down a Mac.) Include representative unit tests, but does not
have to be 100% coverage. Use Dancer2 (https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2)
as your web framework. Use DBIx::Class
(https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class) as your db interface. In memory
SQLite db is probably your simplest option. Try for more than one table
so you can have a relationship.

A UI is not required.

Design

routes:
    ttt/game/new
    ttt/game/list
    ttt/game/new        - create new game, set x_player to current user
    ttt/game/show/:gid  
    ttt/game/join/:gid  - select game by id, set o_player to current user
    ttt/game/move/:gid/:pos - select game by id and put X/O at some position

    ttt/player/new/:name
    ttt/player/list
    ttt/player/:pid/login    ???
    ttt/player/logout        ???

tables:
    games
        game-id
        x_player (X)
        o_player (O)
        board
        status
    players
        player-id
        player-name


Database is in-memory SQLite, so games only exist as long as the app is running.
X always moves first (player1 -> X, player2 -> O)
Store board as a string of 9 characters
3 possibilities: x, o, or .  (. are empty squares)
Winning configurations:
        xxx......   top row
        ...xxx...   middle row
        ......xxx   bottom row
        x..x..x..   left column
        .x..x..x.   middle column
        ..x..x..x   right column
        x...x...x   \ diagonal
        ..x.x.x..   / diagonal
